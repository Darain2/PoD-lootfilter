Darain's Filter for Path of Diablo with select implemented drop-sound notifications from POE.

Download the Darain.zip file and move the whole folder to: Diablo II\Path of Diablo\filter. **(For Sound Support - if you do not care about custom sound drop notifications, you do not need to do this step)**

The .filter file itself also goes to: Diablo II\Path of Diablo\filter.

Work-in-Progress Readme.

Comparisons between Vanilla & Filter: I try to maintain colour scheme while providing relevant information that is legible at a glance. If you think you have a better colour scheme, feel free to suggest. I am open to suggestions. I have previously tried  BLUE for all stats as it appears as BLUE in the inventory, but on the ground, it was very hard to read and differentiate what the actual stats on the items were.
Hides the typical junk items while leveling, truncates potion names, will start hiding Antidote/Stamina/Thawing potions as the character levels up. Health and Mana potions also gets progressively hidden at Reset level as player levels up. "Reset" Filter Level will always show Super Health/Mana potion.
