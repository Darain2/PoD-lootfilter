# Darain's Vanilla+ PoD Loot Filter
Hello and welcome to my filter. My basic goal of this filter is to have a relatively fuss-free filter that hides the basic un-usable items, while preserving the colour scheme of the vanilla game. If you spot any discrepancies, please let me know here or on Discord.

# About
Implemented three drop-sound notifications from POE. (1) Map Drop sound, (2) Vaal Orb sound, (3) Divine orb tink. Courtesy of Neversink from POE.
Implemented map-icons for notable drops.
Implemented ground-based display of stats for most "interesting" items. See below for screenshots.

# Installation
Download the Darain.zip file and move the whole folder to: Diablo II\Path of Diablo\filter. **(For Sound Support - if you do not care about custom sound drop notifications, you do not need to do this step)**

The .filter file itself also goes to: Diablo II\Path of Diablo\filter.


Option 1: Copy/Paste this URL into Launcher: https://github.com/Darain2/PoD-lootfilter/raw/main/Darain%20Shungite.filter

It will appear as item.filter in-game using this option. Select it from dropdown menu (in-game hotkey "H"). Select appropriate Filter Level. If first-timer, select "Reset" + Notification Priority "Low"
