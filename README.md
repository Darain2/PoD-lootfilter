Darain's Filter for Path of Diablo with select implemented drop-sound notifications from POE.

Download the Darain.zip file and move the whole folder to: Diablo II\Path of Diablo\filter. **(For Sound Support - if you do not care about custom sound drop notifications, you do not need to do this step)**

The .filter file itself also goes to: Diablo II\Path of Diablo\filter.

Comparisons between Vanilla | Filter - I try to maintain colour scheme while providing relevant information that is legible at a glance. If you think you have a better colour scheme, feel free to suggest. I am open to suggestions. I have previously toyed with BLUE for all stats as it appears as BLUE in the inventory, but on the ground, it was very hard to read and differentiate what the actual stats on the items were.
